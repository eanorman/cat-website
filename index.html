    <h2>Binx</h2>
    <p>Binx was found by my friend in the parking lot of his apartment complex. Binx is a very sweet boy who loves to
        cuddle and enjoys eating snacks.</p>
    <h2>Denise</h2>
    <p>Denise was given to my fiance by his sister-in-law. Denise is a grumpy old lady we are very fond of. She enjoys
        long naps and scratches on her chin.</p>
    <h2>Sally</h2>
    <p>Sally was adopted from IACS. I knew she was the perfect cat for me when she jumped into my arms and was ready to
        go home. Sally enjoys lots of cuddles and playing with her toys.</p>
